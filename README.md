# superpipe
cloud computing is everywhere but this is costly where we need to process time consuming process, especially for small and medium enterprise and indiviuals. Superpipe is a special communication protocol to compute locally or ephermal machine and share result. This is a hybrid approach. With a simple 5$USD machine, you can run $500usd tasks such as complex simulation or long running interactive task. 

This is basically a framework for shared computing.
